##Stream Power Function

**Stream power** is the rate of energy dissipation against the bed and banks of a river or stream per unit downstream length. It is given by the equation:

$\Omega =\rho gQS$

where $\Omega$ is the stream power, $\rho$ is the density of water (1000 $\frac{kg}{m^3}$), $g$ is acceleration due to gravity (9.8 $\frac{m}{s^2}$), $Q$ is discharge ($\frac{m^3}{s}$), and $S$ is the channel slope.

###Contract
*Input*: Discharge ($Q$) in $\frac{m^3}{s}$ and channel slope ($S$).

*Output*: Stream power ($\Omega$) in W.

*Parameters*: Density of water ($\rho$) and acceleration due to gravity ($g$).
